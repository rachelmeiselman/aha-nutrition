Hey!

Features we're looking to include: 
- We are looking to have a button that translates to Polish/Spanish (the whole thing) as a separate button at the top
- Make it more user-friendly, clicking "enter" on the keyboard should do the same thing as show my reccomendations, get rid of the arrow thing on the side and instead have a dropdown memu that shows -- 2000 is the daily reccomended calories--- and 1800 for more sedentary lifestyles-- 2200 for more active lifestyles)
- Language like type in calories here
- understanding what copy to clipboard means-- more user-friendly
-
